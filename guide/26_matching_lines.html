<pre><code>Now is the winter of our discontent.
All children, except one, grow up.
The Galactic Empire was dying.
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.
It was a pleasure to burn.
It was a bright, cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
It was love at first sight.

</code></pre><p>You will often want to search files to find lines that match a certain pattern. The Unix command <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> does this (and much more). The following examples show how you can use grep&#39;s command-line options to:</p>
<ul>
<li>show lines that match a specified pattern</li>
<li>ignore case when matching (<code>-i</code>)</li>
<li>only match whole words (<code>-w</code>)</li>
<li>show lines that don&#39;t match a pattern (<code>-v</code>)</li>
<li>Use wildcard characters and other patterns to allow for alternatives (<code>*</code>, <code>.</code>, and <code>[]</code>)</li>
</ul>
